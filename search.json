And outliers are more evident in the group with a low percentage of males employed in agriculture.\nWe also examine how the percentage of males employed in agriculture affects the average infant mortality rate.\n\nknitr::kable(\ncategory_data %&gt;% group_by(Agriculture_group) %&gt;%\n  summarize(Mean_infant_mortality = round(mean(Infant.Mortality),2)) %&gt;%\n  rename(Ag_group=Agriculture_group)%&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Mean_infant_mortality)))\n\n\n\n\n\nAg_group\nMean_infant_mortality\n\n\n\n\nLow\n20.04\n\n\nMedium\n19.91\n\n\nHigh\n19.87\n\n\n\n\nWe notice that mean infant mortality was fairly similar between different agriculture groups (abbreviated as Ag_group in the table).

Additionally, provinces with lower education levels tend to perform worse on examinations and exhibit higher fertility rates. In groups with low percentages of males employed in agriculture, draftees are more likely to achieve the highest scores on the military exam."
